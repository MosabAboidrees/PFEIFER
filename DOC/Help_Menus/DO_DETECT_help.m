%% Detect Fiducials
% If this option is one, fiducials are added to the time series and
% eventually saved (in ts.fids) with them. Fiducials are optained either by
% the user (if 'User Interaction' is selected) or the fiducials optained
% through earlier user selections from earlier processing (stored and retrieved via the
% ProcessingData file) are used.
%
% Detection of fiducials is necessary for Integral Maps and to create
% Activation/Recovery maps.
