% prior the 'Baseline Fiducials Display'. For details on how the baseline correction
% is done see the help for 'Baseline Correction'.  In the case of a Pre_RMS
% baseline correction the following start and endpoints are used for the
% baseline correction: If baseline values are provided in the
% myProcessingScript file, then those values are used. Otherwise the very
% first and the very last time frames of the potvals are used.
